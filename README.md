# Sidewalk Doc MapKit test

A test for the [Sidewalk Doc](https://github.com/ChallaHalla/sidewalkDocMobileApp) mobile app. 

Demonstrates how to:

- Get Location Services permission from user both in-app and in the background.

- Display an MKMapView and show user's current location on it.

- Display another user's location (normally gotten through the internet, but simulated in this demo) and mark it with a pin.

- Center map between both users' locations so that they are both visible.

- Recenter map whenever either user's location is updated.

Code from this repo has been integrated into the Sidewalk Doc app.
