# Sidewalk Doc MapKit test

A test for the MapKit portion of the [Sidewalk Doc](https://github.com/ChallaHalla/sidewalkDocMobileApp) mobile app. Code from this repo has been integrated into multiple ViewControllers of the Sidewalk Doc app.

This test demonstrates how to:

- Get Location Services (both in-app and in the background) permission from user.

- Display an MKMapView and show user's current location on it.

- Display another user's location (normally gotten through the internet, but simulated in this demo) and mark it with a pin.

- Center map between two users' locations so that they are both visible.

- Recenter map whenever either user's location is updated.
